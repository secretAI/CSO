[CSO] - Web Application introducing online-shop with separated client and server side.

SERVER.
Stack: 
  - Typescript (with Eslint);

  - Express;
  - Nodemailer.

What have I done already:

  - Routing;
  - Error Handling with custom Error classes;
  - Services;
  - Authorization with pair of JWTs. Sign Up with activation via gmail. Token refresh option for every auth'ed user. Possibility of getting a list of all users while having some permissions (authorized + admin).

Got nothing to show you yet, but stay tuned..
